## Site goal

This website is constructed for the foodies out there who love to cook and find new recipes. They are able to post their own construction, get to know each other and find new inspiration. The main goal was to create a space where people can highten their passion for food.

### Agile Planning

This project was developed using agile methods during a 2 week period.

All of the stories created for this project have been placed in a "To do", "In Progress" and "Done" to make it easier for me and to map out where I should start. Most of the stories have criteria assigned to them where you can see what they need to be marked as "Done". This is called a Kanban board and it was created using the github projects and can be located [here](https://github.com/users/MollyAdamsson/projects/7/views/1).

## Future Features

In the future I would like to add a form of grocery shopping list. Here the user can like a recipe and then get a full shopping list where they can schoose how many people they want to cook for and then get a proper list with the right amount of ingredients.

In the future I would also like to add some more styling and finesse to make the site even better looking.

## Testing

## Deployment

### [Elephantsql](https://www.elephantsql.com/) 

* Heroku needs sql's to work
* ElephantSQL will manage administrative tasks of PostgreSQL, such as installation, upgrades to latest stable version and backup handling.
* It automates every part of setup and running of PostgreSQL clusters.

1. Log into Heroku 
The first step to creating a free PostgreSQL database is to log in to Heroku. To create a new database on Heroku, an app must first be created within the personal dashboard. 

2. Create a new Heroku app 
Once logged in to Heroku, navigate to the personal app dashboard to create a new Heroku app. Simply click the Create new app button, which should be located on the top-right corner of the dashboard. 

3. Add a PostgreSQL database 
After creating the new app, it's time to attach a PostgreSQL database to it. Simply navigate to the Resources tab located in the header of the app's dashboard. Add the ElephantSql and a free PostgreSQL database has now been successfully created. 

### [Github](https://github.com/) 

* When logging into github, navigate to the settings tab
* Here you can find pages down on the left side
* A new page will load which will present the branch to master or main, and then the save option
* Once the save button has been clicked and the page is reloaded there will be a link to the deployed site.

### [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) Deployment:

* Ensure your requirements.txt file has the required dependencies. To do this you can use the following
code in your IDE: pip3 freeze > requirements.txt
* Create or login to you Heroku account
* Navigate to Dashboard
