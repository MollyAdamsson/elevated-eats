## Site goal

This website is constructed for the foodies out there who love to cook and find new recipes. They are able to post their own construction, get to know each other and find new inspiration. The main goal was to create a space where people can highten their passion for food.

### Agile Planning

This project was developed using agile methods during a 2 week period.

All of the stories created for this project have been placed in a "To do", "In Progress" and "Done" to make it easier for me and to map out where I should start. Most of the stories have criteria assigned to them where you can see what they need to be marked as "Done". This is called a Kanban board and it was created using the github projects and can be located [here](https://github.com/users/MollyAdamsson/projects/7/views/1).

## Future Features

In the future I would like to add a form of grocery shopping list. Here the user can like a recipe and then get a full shopping list where they can schoose how many people they want to cook for and then get a proper list with the right amount of ingredients.

In the future I would also like to add some more styling and finesse to make the site even better looking.
